Step 1 : This code was worked in Jupyter environment on python. I am not sure whether it will run in Gitlab repository, so it is recommended to download and upload the file in Jupyter notebook, else Google Co-labs to get the code working in the right file type. 

Step 2: The file contains 5 different folders that include England, Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Combined. The first 4 contain codes that shows how data pre processing, data cleaning and exploratory analysis is conducted indivdually. The combined file consists of the dataset that is combined from previous four and the modelling is conducted.

Step 3: Please click on run kernel to run the whole code. However, please note that all the sections of Data preprocessing and Data Cleaning at the end of the code saves a file that was later combined in the Combined folder. Please ignore when a new file is created or you can erase that code and run the program as the file is already present in the respective folders as .csv file.

Step 4: Once indivdual files are inspected, the combined file consists of notebooks of -
Combined Exploratory Analysis.ipynb (Just exploratory analysis on a combined dataset that is explained in the report)
Combining Dataset.ipynb (Concatenate indivdual datasets as one)
House Prediction Neural Networks.ipynb (!!!!!! MOST IMPORTANT !!!!!! this is the main modelling of neural netowrk of the project, can be run regularly and instructions give if parameters needs to be changed for testing) 
Random Forest Regressor.ipynb (Ignore this as it is there as reference if needed to analyse as the model did not perform well) 

Note: This file will be uploaded in Gitlab repository, but if not working it will still be sent indivdually to supervisor and uploaded on canvas as a backup incase the gitlab cannot recieve this file
